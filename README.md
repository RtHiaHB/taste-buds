# Taste Buds web-site

This repo represents the web-site of a fictional restaurant chain called "Taste Buds." It is primarily serves American cuisine in the Raleigh-Durham area.

There are two pieces to this: the back-end and the front-end, each in their own folder.  This uses PostGres, and a PostGres server is required.

## Back-End

We recommend that you get the back-end started first.  After forking and cloning, you should install the following: Express, cors, Sequelize, and dotenv.

Once that's done, we recommend you run the migration files and then the seed file to load the locations and the menu.

## Front-End

Once this is downloaded, you need to install react, react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, and bootstrap.

That should get you up and running.

## Future development

Our plan is for there to eventually be a working order page, which is our next step.  Also, a way for users to log in so they can save preferences, etc.
